  abstract = {Despite substantial focus on sustainability issues in both science and politics, humanity remains on largely unsustainable development trajectories. Partly, this is due to the failure of sustainability science to engage with the root causes of unsustainability. Drawing on ideas by Donella Meadows, we argue that many sustainability interventions target highly tangible, but essentially weak, leverage points (i.e. using interventions that are easy, but have limited potential for transformational change). Thus, there is an urgent need to focus on less obvious but potentially far more powerful areas of intervention. We propose a research agenda inspired by systems thinking that focuses on transformational `sustainability interventions', centred on three realms of leverage: reconnecting people to nature, restructuring institutions and rethinking how knowledge is created and used in pursuit of sustainability. The notion of leverage points has the potential to act as a boundary object for genuinely transformational sustainability science.},

The article reviews the state of the literature on this topic by focusing on six pathways by which Indigenous peoples and local communities engage with management of and relationships to nature. These are (a) undertaking territorial management practices and customary governance, (b) contributing to nature conservation and restoration efforts with regional to global implications, (c) co-constructing knowledge for assessments and monitoring, (d) countering the drivers of unsustainable resource use and resisting environmental injustices, (e) playing key roles in environmental governance across scales, and (f) offering alternative conceptualizations of the interrelations between people and nature. The review shows that through these pathways Indigenous peoples and local communities are making significant contributions to managing the health of local and regional ecosystems, to producing knowledge based in diverse values of nature, confronting societal pressures and environmental burdens, and leading and partnering in environmental governance. These contributions have local to global implications but have yet to be fully recognized in conservation and development polices, and by society at large.},

It is still unknown, however, to what degree their survival is jeopardized by the loss of either plant species or knowledge about their services. To fill this gap, here we introduce indigenous knowledge networks describing the wisdom of indigenous people on plant species and the services they provide. Our results across 57 Neotropical communities show that cultural heritage is as important as plants for preserving indigenous knowledge both locally and regionally. Indeed, knowledge networks collapse as fast when plant species are driven extinct as when cultural diffusion, either within or among communities, is lost. But it is the joint loss of plant species and knowledge that erodes these networks at a much higher rate. Our findings pave the road toward integrative policies that recognize more explicitly the inseparable links between cultural and biological heritage.},

  abstract = {Humans and the environment form a single complex system where humans not only influence ecosystems but also react to them. Despite this, there are far fewer coupled human--environment system (CHES) mathematical models than models of uncoupled ecosystems. We argue that these coupled models are essential to understand the impacts of social interventions and their potential to avoid catastrophic environmental events and support sustainable trajectories on multi-decadal timescales. A brief history of CHES modelling is presented, followed by a review spanning recent CHES models of systems including forests and land use, coral reefs and fishing and climate change mitigation. The ability of CHES modelling to capture dynamic two-way feedback confers advantages, such as the ability to represent ecosystem dynamics more realistically at longer timescales, and allowing insights that cannot be generated using ecological models. We discuss examples of such key insights from recent research. However, this strength brings with it challenges of model complexity and tractability, and the need for appropriate data to parameterize and validate CHES models. Finally, we suggest opportunities for CHES models to improve human--environment sustainability in future research spanning topics such as natural disturbances, social structure, social media data, model discovery and early warning signals.

  abstract = {Drawing on seminal work by the late Donella Meadows, we propose a leverage points perspective as a hitherto under-recognized heuristic and practical tool for sustainability science. A leverage points perspective focuses on places to intervene in complex systems to bring about transformative change. A leverage points perspective recognizes increasingly influential leverage points relating to changes in parameters, feedbacks, system design and the intent encapsulated by a given system. We discuss four key advantages of a leverage points perspective. First advantage: A leverage points perspective can bridge causal and teleological explanations of system change -- that is, change is seen to arise from variables influencing one another, but also from how human intent shapes the trajectory of a system. Second advantage: A leverage points perspective explicitly recognizes influential, `deep' leverage points -- places at which interventions are difficult but likely to yield truly transformative change. Third advantage: A leverage points perspective enables the examination of interactions between shallow and deep system changes -- sometimes, relatively superficial interventions may pave the way for deeper changes, while at other times, deeper changes may be required for superficial interventions to work. Fourth advantage: A leverage points perspective can function as a methodological boundary object -- that is, providing a common entry point for academics from different disciplines and other societal stakeholders to work together. Drawing on these strengths could initiate a new stream of sustainability studies, and may yield both practical and theoretical advances. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

  abstract = {In 1997, Robert Axelrod wondered in a highly influential paper "If people tend to become more alike in their beliefs, attitudes, and behavior when they interact, why do not all such differences eventually disappear?" Axelrod's question highlighted an ongoing quest for formal theoretical answers joined by researchers from a wide range of disciplines. Numerous models have been developed to understand why and under what conditions diversity in beliefs, attitudes and behavior can co-exist with the fact that very often in interactions, social influence reduces differences between people. Reviewing three prominent approaches, we discuss the theoretical ingredients that researchers added to classic models of social influence as well as their implications. Then, we propose two main frontiers for future research. First, there is urgent need for more theoretical work comparing, relating and integrating alternative models. Second, the field suffers from a strong imbalance between a proliferation of theoretical studies and a dearth of empirical work. More empirical work is needed testing and underpinning micro-level assumptions about social influence as well as macro-level predictions. In conclusion, we discuss major roadblocks that need to be overcome to achieve progress on each frontier. We also propose that a new generation of empirically-based computational social influence models can make unique contributions for understanding key societal challenges, like the possible effects of social media on societal polarization.},

However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels.We explain which aspects of amodel should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix.We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

Current research predominantly analyzes how crossing tipping points causes regime shifts, however, the analysis of potential transition pathways from these social and ecological tipping points is often overlooked. In this paper, we analyze transition pathways and the potential outcomes that these may lead to via a stylized model of a system composed of interacting agents exploiting resources and, by extension, the overall ecosystem. Interactions between the social and the ecological system are based on a perception-exploitation framework. We show that the presence of tipping points in SES may yield counter-intuitive social-ecological transition pathways. For example, the high perception of an alarming ecological state among agents can provide short-term ecological benefits, but can be less effective in the long term, compared to a low-perception condition. This work also highlights how understanding non-linear interactions is critical for defining suitable transition pathways of any SES.},

  abstract = {[!!! The document contains equations that cannot be typed appropriately in this field. We have appended the text anyway, but the manuscript document will be more appropriate. !!!]1. Distribution analyses and bimodalityDistribution analyses are becoming increasingly popular in the psychological literature as they promise invaluable information about hidden cognitive processes (e.g., Freeman \&amp; Dale, 2013; Miller, 2006; Ratcliff, Van Zandt, \&amp; McKoon, 1999; Ratcliff \&amp; Rouder, 1998; Wagenmakers, Grasman, \&amp; Molenaar, 2005). One particular approach probes distributions for uni- versus bimodality, because bimodality often results from the contribution of dual processes underlying the observed data (Freeman \&amp; Dale, 2013; Larkin, 1979; see Knapp, 2007, for a historical overview). Although several statistical tools for this purpose exist, it remains unclear which one can be considered as a gold standard for assessing bimodality in practice.Freeman and Dale (2013) have recently shed some light on the utility of three different measures of bimodality known as the bimodality coefficient (BC; SAS Institute, 1990), Hartigan's dip statistic (HDS; Hartigan \&amp; Hartigan, 1985), and Akaike's information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1974) as applied to one-component and two-component Gaussian mixture distribution models (McLachlan \&amp; Peel, 2000). Overall, their analyses favored the HDS but also credited the BC with considerable utility. Notably, however, rather different formulas for the BC can be found in the literature (``Bimodal distribution'', 2013; Freeman \&amp; Dale, 2013; Knapp, 2007; SAS Institute, 1990, 2012) -- certainly a potential source of confusion among researchers using the BC. Additionally, the Appendix of Freeman and Dale (2013) gives a misleading formula for the BC because their approach used non-standard MATLAB functions that are not widely accessible. The present article aims at clarifying and correcting these issues in an attempt to prevent misunderstanding and confusion. Further, methodological issues in using this measure are sketched to provide an intuition about its behavior. Note that the current paper does not intend to argue in favor of the BC as compared to other measures (see Freeman \&amp; Dale, 2013, for a thorough comparison). Rather, we want to point out pitfalls and limitations of this measure that can easily be overlooked.2. The BC and its caveatsThe computation of the BC is easy and straightforward as it only requires three numbers: the sample size n, the skewness of the distribution of interest, and its excess kurtosis (see DeCarlo, 1997, and Joanes \&amp; Gill, 1998, for a detailed description of the latter two statistics). First appearing as part of the SAS procedure CLUSTER under the headline ``Miscellaneous Formulas'' of the SAS User's Guide (SAS Institute, 1990, p. 561), the original formulation of the BC is ,with m3 referring to the skewness of the distribution and m4 referring to its excess kurtosis (see Knapp, 2007, for critical remarks about this notation), with both moments being corrected for sample bias (cf. Joanes \&amp; Gill, 1998). The BC of a given empirical distribution is then compared to a benchmark value of that would be expected for a uniform distribution; higher numbers point towards bimodality whereas lower numbers point towards unimodality. Freeman and Dale (2013) gave information about computation of the BC with Matlab, but unfortunately two problems likely arise from using their code (for more information and examples of calculation with different software packages, see the online material): First, the call m3 = skew(x);likely results in an error, as skew() is not a native Matlab function. The correct call should bem3 = skewness(x,0);where the second input parameter 0 prompts the necessary correction for sample bias. Secondly, kurtosis() computes Pearson's original kurtosis (The MathWorks Inc., 2012). To obtain the correct and sample-bias corrected value, the correct call should bem4 = kurtosis(x,0)-3;Irrespective of these computational issues, the above-mentioned formula reveals that the BC is directly influenced by both, skewness and kurtosis: Higher BCs result from high absolute values of skewness and low or negative values of kurtosis. Especially the influence of skewness can result in undesired behavior of the BC. As an illustration, four hypothetical distributions of 100 values each (range 1-11) are plotted in Figure 1, including their skewness, kurtosis, and the resulting BC (see Appendix 1 for the raw data). [Figure 1 about here]Comparing distribution A and B reveals the expected behavior of the BC: The two obvious modes in distribution B decrease kurtosis and increase the BC. Distribution C, however, is clearly unimodal when inspected by eye but its heavy skew also leads to a large BC. In terms of the BC, distribution C is even more bimodal than distribution D even though distribution D clearly has two modes, but otherwise both are very similar. The additional mode, however, decreases skewness thereby lowering the BC as long as it is not compensated by (negative) kurtosis.3. ConclusionsAs described above, empirical values of BC \&gt; .555 are taken to indicate bimodality. A probability density function for the bimodality coefficient, however, cannot be derived (Knapp, 2007). This is a major drawback because it precludes a thorough null-hypothesis significance test.A suitable alternative test for bimodality is the dip test (Hartigan \&amp; Hartigan, 1985) that probes for deviations from unimodality (see also Freeman \&amp; Dale, 2013, for a more detailed description). An algorithm for this test was proposed after its publication (Hartigan, 1985) and this algorithm has meanwhile been adopted for MATLAB (Mechler, 2002). Additionally, an up-to-date, bug-corrected version was recently published as an R package (diptest, Maechler, 2012).A direct comparison of the BC and the dip test (Freeman \&amp; Dale, 2013) revealed that both measures have merit for assessing bimodality but neither statistic is perfectly sensitive and specific at the same time. Accordingly, one may assess empirical distributions with both measures and diagnose bimodality especially in case of convergent results. Should the results not converge, it seems the best strategy to investigate distributions for other measures, such as skewness and kurtosis individually (as well as their appearance when inspected by eye), to determine whether the result of the BC might be biased in one or the other direction.},

  abstract = {Social-ecological systems (SES) research offers new theory and evidence to transform sustainable development to better contend with the challenges of the Anthropocene. Four insights from contemporary SES literature on ( a) intertwined SES, ( b) cross-scale dynamics, ( c) systemic tipping points, and ( d) transformational change are explored. Based on these insights, shifts in sustainable development practice are suggested to recognize and govern the complex and codeveloping social and ecological aspects of development challenges. The potential susceptibility of SES to nonlinear systemic reconfigurations is highlighted, as well as the opportunities, agency, and capacities required to foster reconfigurative transformations for sustainable development. SES research proposes the need for diverse values and beliefs that are more in tune with the deep, dynamic connections between social and ecological systems to transform development practice and to support capacities to deal with shocks and surprises. From these perspectives, SES research offers new outlooks, practices, and novel opportunity spaces from which to address the challenges of the Anthropocene.},

  abstract = {Simulation models are widely used to represent the dynamics of ecological systems. A common question with such models is how changes to a parameter value or functional form in the model alter the results. Some authors have chosen to answer that question using frequentist statistical hypothesis tests (e.g. ANOVA). This is inappropriate for two reasons. First, p-values are determined by statistical power (i.e. replication), which can be arbitrarily high in a simulation context, producing minuscule p-values regardless of the effect size. Second, the null hypothesis of no difference between treatments (e.g. parameter values) is known a priori to be false, invalidating the premise of the test. Use of p-values is troublesome (rather than simply irrelevant) because small p-values lend a false sense of importance to observed differences. We argue that modelers should abandon this practice and focus on evaluating the magnitude of differences between simulations. Synthesis Researchers analyzing field or lab data often test ecological hypotheses using frequentist statistics (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) that focus on p-values. Field and lab data usually have limited sample sizes, and p-values are valuable for quantifying the probability of making incorrect inferences in that situation. However, modern ecologists increasingly rely on simulation models to address complex questions, and those who were trained in frequentist statistics often apply the hypothesis-testing approach inappropriately to their simulation results. Our paper explains why p-values are not informative for interpreting simulation models, and suggests better ways to evaluate the ecological significance of model results.},
